### About
This repo is a template if you would like to make mods for boneEngine without having to do all the setup and downloading the source-code and setting up the file structure correctly. If you would like the source code please check the original game's repo linked above (If the repo is private while you are reading this it is because I am still working on a playable product so it is easier to modify).
### About me
Hi there, I'm Thomas. I am a middle-school student currently and I've just finished my exam block. So expect 1 major update every month or so to come to the original games repo from me. If you do not see any major update within a month feel free to join my guilded.gg server and ask me why I haven't made a major update in-case I forgot to upload it.
