### About
This repo is a template if you would like to make mods for boneEngine without having to do all the setup and downloading the source-code and setting up the file structure correctly. If you would like the source code please check the original game's repo linked above (If the repo is private while you are reading this it is because I am still working on a playable product so it is easier to modify).
